## Projects  

- **Grid Art** (`firstassignment_turtle.py`) – This is my first attempt at the turtle assignment. I explored different shapes and played around with colors.  
- **L-System Tree** (`secondassignment_lsystem.py`) – I put in a lot of effort trying to understand L-systems, especially since I am working with algae in one of my projects. It was quite challenging, so I had to ask for some help along the way. :( Here are some variations of L-systems that I’ve worked on.  
- **Christmas Tree** (`thirdassignment_christmas.py`) – Merry Christmas!  I tried the capture the right amount of Christmas spirit!
- **Ornament Generator** (`thirdassignment_christmas_2.py`) – I tried coding some ornaments!
